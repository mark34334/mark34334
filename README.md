## ðŸš€ About Me
Hey there, I'm Logesh - part-time student, full-time cyber ninja, and lover of all things code. 

When I'm not busy studying, I enjoy breaking things (digitally, of course) and figuring out how to put them back together. I'm a self-proclaimed Linux geek and know my way around Windows like the back of my hand. I'm also familiar with programming languages like Python, Bash, and C++, and enjoy coding up fun projects in my free time.

Automated Web Recon Tool

I recently built an automated web reconnaissance tool using Bash scripting. This tool makes it easy to perform reconnaissance on a target website, including subdomain enumeration, port scanning, and directory enumeration.

The tool is designed to be easy to use, with a simple command-line interface that allows you to quickly scan a target website and gather information about its structure and potential vulnerabilities.

If you're interested in checking out the tool or contributing to its development, you can find the project (https://github.com/mark34334/project)
